# Client-Checker

# About

The Client Checker takes data from Atera, SentinelOne, and Screenconnect and compiles it all in one place. The completed CSV file will consolidate the information from their respective places, and let the user know which pieces of software are missing from each individual machine. In order to do this, you must gather the CSV files.

# Gathering the Files

# Atera

Atera makes it easy:

•	Reports > Auditor > Select Customer > Export to Excel

Open the xls file in Excel, then:

•	File > Export > Change File Type > Export as CSV 

Save the CSV file in the same directory as the System Checker.

I usually chose a name like "AteraConnally.csv" to not get lost once a bunch of different checks are done.

# Connectwise

This one is a little more involved as screenconnect doesn't have an easy way to generate a report (for now). A comma separated list of usernames must be created for screenconnect.
1.	Select a client
2.	Check all computers
3.	In the top right corner, triple click the list of usernames
4.	Paste the list into a text file in the directory as the System Checker (make sure there isn’t an endline at the end or itll mess up the end of the sheet)
Ex. "ConnectwiseConnally.txt"

# SentinelOne

EZPZ with this one
1.  Go to Sentinels
2.  In the top right, click export. SentinelOne will download a CSV file with all the correct information
3.  Rename endpoints.csv file to something relevant Ex. "SentinelConnally.csv"

# How to Use

Yay! Hopefully you have all the input files you need and you can actually get some work done.

Upon launching the Client Checker, you will be greeted with choices for which files you would like to load. 
![console image](https://imgur.com/a/l6nZpWM)
Select a choice by entering the number listed before the prompt. IE, if I wanted to load an atera file, type 2 then press enter.

After you will be prompted for the file name, type it in exactly how you named it when gathering the input data. Don't forget to add the extension as well.
So, if I wanted to load the Connally Atera file, type "AteraConnally.csv" (or whatever you decided to name it)
For screenconnect "filename.txt".

Once you have loaded in files for Connectwise, Atera, and SentinelOne press 6 to output the file. You will be prompted for an output file name. Obviously the name doesn't matter, just make sure to add ".csv" at the end. You should see the filename in the directory of the ClientChecker and you're done!

# Extra notes
There are choices for Symantec and Sophos, those are WIP and don't do anything in the latest version right now.

If there are any machines on ConnectWise that have been renamed to something else, you will have a duplicate entry in the final data output. So you may have a machine that doesn't seem to have ConnectWise, but it does. You will notice this as you will have a Machine that only has ConnectWise without Atera or SentinelOne. Just use your best judgement as there could actually be a case where Atera or Antivirus is not installed.
